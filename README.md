# Extremely Random Trees

### A C++ implementation of the ExtraTrees algorithm (Pierre Guerts, et al., 2005).

## What

Extremely Random Trees is a machine-learning algorithm,
particularly a more complex version of a Random Forest ensemble.
This is my own implementation of that algorithm as a friendly terminal program.
It can be compiled and executed on any modern Unix/Linux/OSX computer.

## Building

I've provided a Makefile which should do the job.
After you've downloaded this repository, get into its directory in a terminal and do:

'make'

## Running

### Growing A Model

'etgrow'

### Applying A Model

'etpredict'
